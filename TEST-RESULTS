Blackbox test results for Calculator.java

The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where there is only one number and no operations in the imput.This will cause an infinite recursion, as the method will keep calling itself with the same list of numbers and no operations. To fix this, you can add a base case to return if the size of the numbers list is 1.
The 'evaluateExpression' method does not handle the case where the imput expression starts with a division or multiplication symbol. This will cause an 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' when trying to access the first character of the expression. To fix this, you can add similar checks as for addition and subtraction symbols at the beginning of the method.
The 'evaluateExpression' method assumes that the input expression is well-formed and containes at least one number. If the input expression does not contain any numbers or contains only operations, the method will throw an'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' or a 'NumberFormatException'.To fix this, you can add checks to ensure that the input expression is well-formed and contains at least one number.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where there are no operations left in the input. This will cause an infinite recursion, as the method will keep calling itself with an epty list of operations. To fix this you can add a check to return if the list of operations is empty.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive operations in the input. This will cause unexpected results, as the method will only consider the first two numbers and the first operation in the list. To fix this, you can add a loop to iterate over all operations and numbers in the input.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where the input contains parentheses or other grouping symbols. This will cause incorrect results, as the method does not take into account the order of operations. To fix this, you can add support for parentheses and other grouping symbols in the 'evaluateExpression' method.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where the input contains negative numbers with spaces, such as "-1". This will cause a 'NumberFormarException', as the 'parseFloat' method will treat the space as a part of the number. To fiy this, you can remove any spaces around the numbers in the 'evaluateExpression' method.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where the input contains non-numeric characters other than the arithmetic operations and parentheses. This will cause a 'NumberFormarException', as the 'parseFloat' method will not be able to parse the non-numeric characters. To fix this, you can add checks to ensure that the input contains only valid characters.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where the input contains numbers larger than the maximum value of a 'float'. This will cause a loss of precision or an overflow error. To fix it, you can use 'double' or 'BigDecimal' instead of 'float' to represent the numbers.
The 'Calculate' method does not handle the case where the input contains division by zero.This will cause an 'ArithmeticException', as the '/' operatordoes not allow division by zero.To fix this, you can add a check to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the divis

These are just some of the potential issues I found in the given code. There may be other issues as well, depanding on the specific requirements and use casses of the 'Calculator' class.
